            st.markdown("""
                **Causes:**
                - **Water Infiltration:** When water seeps into the ground beneath the road surface, it can weaken the underlying soil. This is particularly problematic during heavy rainfalls, which can erode the roadbed and reduce its structural integrity.
                - **Freeze-Thaw Cycles:** In colder climates, water that has infiltrated cracks in the road can freeze and expand. When it thaws, it contracts, creating stress on the road surface. Repeated freeze-thaw cycles can cause significant cracking and eventually lead to potholes.
                - **Traffic Stress:** Heavy traffic, especially from large vehicles such as trucks and buses, places immense stress on road surfaces. Over time, this constant pressure can exacerbate existing weaknesses in the road, leading to cracks and potholes.

                **Impacts:**
                - **Vehicle Damage:** Potholes can cause significant damage to vehicles, including punctured tires, bent rims, and damaged suspension systems. Repeated impacts can lead to costly repairs and reduced vehicle lifespan.
                - **Safety Risks:** Potholes pose serious safety risks. Drivers may need to swerve suddenly to avoid them, which can lead to loss of control or collisions with other vehicles or objects. Additionally, hitting a pothole can cause drivers to lose control, resulting in accidents and injuries.
                - **Increased Maintenance Costs:** Municipalities and road maintenance agencies face increased costs for road repairs and vehicle damage claims due to potholes. Effective reporting and timely repairs can help reduce these costs and improve overall road safety.
                - **Disruption of Traffic Flow:** Potholes can create disruptions in traffic flow, leading to congestion and delays. Proper maintenance and prompt reporting help ensure smoother traffic conditions and minimize disruptions.
